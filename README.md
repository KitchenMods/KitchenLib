## BepInEx and MelonLoader support

As of v0.3.9, support for BepInEx and MelonLoader will officially be dropped, and all development focus will be Workshop related.

I will keep posting builds for BepInEx and MelonLoader, although I will no longer be actively patching bugs related to those direct loaders.

I will look at Pull Requests, which fix loader-based bugs.

Down the line, I plan to completely phase out these loaders from KitchenLib as the workshop is ultimately the best method for mod distribution.
